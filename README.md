**Microclimate-Strain Map**

Mapping of microclimates to optimal species, strains and suppliers of seeds and bio cultures.


Problem: While some microclimate data is available for some regions on microclimate, it is rarely matched with data on species and strains that are optimal for that microclimate, or suppliers of these species and strains. Having an open and more globally complete picture of gene-to-table data would benefit growers worldwide that cannot access research resources. This could also help the market better price bio supplies and achieve better yields of crops.

This project aims to:

- Create open, reliable and traceable data on gene-to-table results per microclimate.
- Bring to small farmers and urban growers the ability to tailor strains to microclimates.
- Better understand and display microclimates-strain results.

This can be especially beneficial for subsistence farming in developing countries and for urban farming in both developing and developed countries. Both benefit from matching strain traits to a small climate niche.
